Dr. Alan A. Adler,Punctuality,0.5,0.971295634,"Dr. Adler seemed very nice at first- that is why I chose him. However, during the course of my pregnancy at the check ups, I noticed that he was in fact very abrupt, cold and just not really interested in helping me see through my choice of wanting natural childbirth. But again, I gave him the benefit of a doubt, attributing his attitude to his busy schedule. Well, I was wrong! He was terrible at my birth also. In fact, I feel like he ruined the exciting experience completely. He was groggy to the point that he hardly said hello when he walked into the room. He broke my water with not so much as telling me he was doing so. In the end, I had a C-Section, which I felt he wanted for me all along. I had a healthy beautiful baby anyway, but for my next, I WILL definitely not be using this practice.",Gynecologist (OBGYN),44,4.059027778

During my pregnancy I had gone to two different OB offices prior to Dr Adler's practice and I must tell that I found not only a great physician and a very well trained staff, but most important I have found a very knowledgeable team of doctors.
Two weeks ago I gave birth to my little girl thanks to the outstanding job of Dr. Adler and his team who were able to identify that I was at a High-Risk Pregnancy and developed a plan to make sure my baby would be born safely and healthy.
I highly recommend Dr. Adler's practice because besides my pregnancy every question or medical condition I had was always very well explained, and also it was always very easy of scheduling appointments and there was never waiting time considering that 99% of my every week appointments were on time. The office environment is very well clean and organized, plus a

Dr. Alan B. Kadet,Punctuality,0.666666667,0.917041482,"I've been going to Dr Kadet for around 4 years now. His staff is nasty, especially the lady(ies) that works the front desk. She ALWAYS asks for co-pay when I visit for my annual check up and I ALWAYS remind her that since this is my annual check-up, there is ZERO copay regardless of what insurance you have. Her response is always an eye roll or some nasty response. As for Dr Kadet, he seems to be a great Doctor. Thankfully, I'm young and healthy and don't have much to worry about. Perhaps that why he spends literally zero time with me. I do feel rushed and almost pressured not to ask him any questions. I visit the Dr once a year so I feel that i'm entitled to ask questions or express concerns. His schedule is so tight he just doesn't really seem to care about you. I'm sure he does, but his actions don't show it. I received something in the mail from him about how he is restructuring his practice and perhaps he is doing so because of the very reason I listed above - the healthcare system doesn't really allow him to spend time with patients and forces him to rush through just to cover his bills. So he will be ""limiting his panel"" so he can focus more time on a small group of patitents.. an exclusive club if you will, but it will cost you. I don't think I will be joining this club.",Family Doctor / G.P.,26,4.02984127

It was a bit more to plan since I live in Boston, but I wanted the best doctor for such an involved proceedure with visually lasting effects, and I felt that doctor was Dr. Engler. Due to upcoming events, I wanted the surgery soon as possible which they accomodated. He & his staff called several times in advance to discuss details. When the surgery week arrived, there were new challenges that came up, complicated by the fact that I was in Boston. Dr Engler & his staff had me come in a little later on my surgery day and they stayed after hours to accomodate me.

Sent me at his own office for a complete blood test but conveniently he ""forgot to mention"" that that test will include a genetic test (I would have said no to that on my first appointment). I had to come back to his office twice when I left to pick up other procedures referrals because his receptionist ""forgot"" to gave it to me. He seemed more interested in pregnant women than in ones like me that are still trying to conceive.

When I got pregnant again, by the results of the sono in his office he was confident that I had an ectopic pregnancy, he sent me to another place with better equipment: thank g-d everything was OK. I called the office few times, but he never returned my call. Finally, when I reached his medical assistant, she said why I was bothering them if everything was fine.

She always responds to calls. She personally calls with test results and the like if they are not completely normal. She is an ""old-fashioned"" doctor in that she knows who you are and cares about your health. I have never had a problem with the staff, billing, referrals, or anything else. I highly recommend her. I would rather bring a book and wait an hour to see a very competent doctor who practices comprehensive medicine than be in and out in 15 minutes with a doctor who treats me as simply the 35th patient of the day.

I had huge round eyes, like saucers, with scarring above and below both eyes. He placed the incisions well above the natural crease of my eyes and flared them up to my eyebrows. This was extremely visible a year after surgery. This incompetent doctor left the fat pads in the corner of my eyes; he never removed them which was part of the surgery. My eyes were no longer symmetrical. One eye was pulled down at the corner. It looked like a ""sad eye."" His stitching was so bad; he left ""dog ears.""

I also think he was super honest in telling me he can't say whether I have a cavity under my crown or not (which my previous dentist had told me was the case). Pretty cool. Then Alexi (sorry if I got her name wrong!) was super awesome and took lots of time to help me understand how best to handle my follow-up appointments to take the most advantage of my insurance, which no dental office or doctor's office has ever done for me.

Dr. Feldman did not recommend removal of the Baker’s cyst the first four times I went to him with the same issue – swelling, pain, etc. We managed it pretty well until this winter when the pain got too severe and the swelling wouldn’t go down. He said removing a Baker’s cyst is the last resort and indicated only when it impacts a patient’s life. It was definitely ruining my life so we made a decision to go ahead with the surgery. I was terrified, but Dr. Feldman was calm and confident, which helped allay my fears.

Dr. Anna Barbieri,Punctuality,0.5,0.927042946,"First off I want to state that I was referred to this practice by another Mt. Sinai physician. I myself am the daughter of a physician and nearly my entire family is comprised of physicians, OBs included, so I understand how busy and stressed doctors are.
That does NOT excuse the following care I've received:
Dr. Barbieri has been my OB for the past 2 years. I got abnormal results from my pap and I have been trying to get in touch with her since 3/29 to discuss my results to no avail. I've emailed her via the patient portal 3 times (they are all still unread) and called the office numerous times though no call back from her. Dr. Barbieri told me I didn't even need to get a pap smear done since I had one last year - maybe that's the new standard but I'm not comfortable with it and I felt like i had to convince HER to give ME a pap. Thank god I insisted. Dr. Averbuch called me back instead regarding my abnormal results. I found her to be extremely dismissive and it was like pulling teeth to get information out of her.
Not to mention, my appointment was 2.5 hours late and I felt EXTREMELY rushed through my appointment with Dr. Barbieri.
Needless to say, I pointed out a lump to her that I felt about a month prior to my appointment. She referred me to a radiologist and the biopsy came back as cancerous. Again, thank God i felt the lump because who knows if she would have found it during how RUSHED she was throughout my appointment.
I have called her 3 times, emailed her again via the patient portal, and AGAIN she has failed to call me to discuss my results for now a FULL 3 DAYS SINCE RECEIVING A CANCER DIAGNOSIS. Dr. Averbuch did, to which again I stated that I would like to speak to MY physician directly. There was no chance I was going to endure her tone again.
I am SO disappointed, upset and frustrated. I would advise women to STAY AWAY from this practice. The standard of care and lack of follow up and communication is horrendous. We deserve better.",Gynecologist (OBGYN),17,4.054871795

You know you are being well taken care of. I have no special problems, but see him for a routine checkup once a year. He remembers me and greets me with genuine warmth, noting any changes he sees during the exam. What might be a stressful visit is never less than a pleasure. I don't know how he manages to never cause a moment's pain during his examination, but somehow it's over before I know it and not a twinge. When he heard that my internist suspected a urinary infection at my recent visit, but would be out of town briefly, he insisted upon running his own test (via lab) and called me personally to give me the results and talk about what kind of medication to prescribe.

Dr. Boris Abayev,Punctuality,0.902439024,0.940053359,"This man almost killed my mother.
She went to Dr.Abayev twice to get pain relieving shots in her back and the first two times went well. Unfortunately, the third time almost cost her her life. She was having a lot of pain in her middle back on the right side. The goal was to give her an injection of plain saline and lidocaine into her muscle to relieve the tension and pain. We came in and spoke to the doctor and it was supposed to be a simple procedure. Most pain management doctors only give their patients injections under a machine to make sure that they're injecting only the muscles and not hitting any blood vessels or organs. He didn't have such a machine but seemed like he knew what he was doing, so me and her trusted him and he went ahead with the injection. He injected lidocaine into two spots that were causing her pain, about 1 inch from one another. Soon as he was done, she starts complaining that she's having trouble breathing. I tell her it's probably because the muscle is tense and is causing her pain. However over the next few hours, the pain just worsens and worsens, we call him half an hour after the injection and he says to give her a painkiller and says that the pain should get better. She takes 2 advils, however is still in extreme pain. Over the course of the evening she was having a really hard time breathing, could barely walk, and was in intense pain despite taking an advil. Again, we think that this is due to her muscle and give her a muscle relaxer. Still no relief, she was still in pain by nightfall and nothing seemed to be working. I tell her to take an Aleve and we'll go to the hospital in the morning to figure out what happened. She has trouble sleeping all night, she can't even lay down, and has trouble standing.
In the morning, she goes with my dad to Columbus Medical and visits a physical therapist there. At this point she is absolutely exhausted, in excruciating pain, is having a lot of trouble breathing, and is pale. The doctor takes one look at her and says, you need to head straight to the hospital, I think that the needle punctured your lung. As they're packing to leave, my mom collapses. All the doctors and nurses are literally fighting to wake her up, her heart rate is through the roof (156 bpm) and spo2 is low. They put on an oxygen mask for her and it takes her 5 minutes to regain consciousness. At this point, the doctor calls an ambulance to get her into the emergency room ASAP.
I get a call from my aunt saying that my mom is in the hospital, and that they're sending her for an xray because they're suspecting a collapsed lung. I'm in complete shock because this would have never crossed my mind. Who knew a needle could get through into her lung. My aunt tells me she collapsed in Columbus and called her as soon as she regained consciousness, telling my aunt to take care of her kids because she thinks she's dying. I grab my jacket and my little sister and head to the hospital.
I get to the hospital in complete shock that my worse nightmare is coming true. I am even more shocked to see that Dr.Abayev, is there too. My mom called him to tell him the news and he came over. He then proceeds to start ARGUING with the doctors that are trying to save her life. He claims that they don't know what they're doing, that they didn't know how much the lung collapsed (we showed him the xray where it is quite obvious that there is barely any lung mass left on top). He also claims that they don't know her spo2 levels, which was literally displayed on the monitor along with her high heart rate reaching up to 150. He proceeds arguing and claims that they shouldn't operate on her, and to let her be because the lung will heal itself. He even has the audacity to look at the head pulmonary specialist in the hospital and tell him he's wrong. We end up telling him to leave and go ahead with the surgery. During the procedure, doctors find out that she was bleeding internally and sucked out more than 1.5 liter of blood. Without the surgery, she would have died.

Moreover, doctors in ER (Coney Island Hospital) told me that it looks like I have a cancer. My son immediately took me to Mount Sinai Hospital the same night, called Dr. Ascher-Walsh asking him to see me. Doctor agreed to see me next day, month before my official appointment with him. It was the most pleasant appointment I had: Doctor was calm, smiled, joked, listened to me very attentively, read the papers with all test results I had, reassured me - he didn't see any cancerous issues with my ovary, said I need surgery to take out both ovaries with a huge old cyst that was cause of my several months pain. He said at my age it's better to take these organs out because the chance of cancer is higher after menopause. Doctor explained the surgery and it sounded like very easy procedure, he looked like its so ""uninteresting"" for him (better to have simple case than something complicated and interesting!) that I left him being happy and optimistic, without fear at all (I'm a coward by nature). In two weeks I had surgery. Everything was excellent: explanations, talking, warm atmosphere and Doctor smiling at me... I've been sleeping after surgery when Doctor called my son telling him how everything was done, the findings and results, no worries. Doctor took out only what was really necessary to get rid of. I had only two painkiller pills on the day of surgery. Next day - no pain at all! Yes, I was weak, but I walked by apartment and every day was improvement.

Dr Kong became very impatient, and she abruptly left the room after the procedure, leaving me alone, although I said I was faint and nauseated.

When we arrived at the hospital every staff member we spoke to from the nurses to the anesthesiologist made a comment on the side how we were in the best and most METICULOUS hands they had ever seen. The doctor on the hospital staff that assisted Dr. Antoine with the procedure said to Dr. Antoine at the end of my surgery she hoped to work with him a lot more because she felt everyone could learn from him. And they were right. My recovery was incredibly fast and my scar is so small you would not believe I gave birth to a baby just under 10 lbs.
His patients are his priority and no matter what your needs are he will always make himself available. I still can't believe how quickly he will call you back with any question you have.
Just to emphasize how respected Dr. Antoine is I think its beneficial to know how he ended up my OBGYN. I was recommended to Dr. Antoine from a close friend that was a nurse at NYU. He delivered her son and she had nothing but glowing reviews. She found Dr. Antoine because she asked around the hospital who nurses and doctors recommend as an OBGYN and his name continually came up. You know you have a top doctor when other doctors and nurses recommend him.
But its not just Dr. Antoine that makes Compassionate OBGYN an incredible practice. You will not find a nicer and more caring nurse then Irina. She always has a smile on her face and makes each visit a personal and important experience. Peggy who works at the front and does all the billing and scheduling is beyond accommodating and makes sure any questions or needs you have are addressed immediately.
Last year my family moved to the South and I still come back to New York to see Dr. Antoine because I know I will never find another OBGYN like him.",Gynecologist (OBGYN),68,4.37202381

I now have metal braces and am happy. Johnson, like a good salesman, never warned me, and never offered to put metal braces at the end. He can’t install metal braces anyhow because he is not an actual orthodontist; Johnson is a general dentist who only took some classes from Invisilign, so he will always recommend Invisilign.

From the moment we first met with him, Dr. Stein was calming and reassuring force. He walked us through our options, fully cognizant of the fact that we were real people facing uncertainties and anxieties in a difficult time. He told us the truth, didn't sugar over any of the hard facts, but never took away our hope and made us feel as if we had someone incredible pulling for us in our corner.
When we started the IVF process, and worked along side the team at RMA, it became clear to us that Dr. Stein's reassuring warm touch were not unique to him, but rather a prerequisite for working at RMA. To a person, the receptionist, billing folks, nurses, technicians, and physicians, were incredible and made us feel like we were in truly supported. For anyone who has experienced, or is considering IVF, it goes without saying but that support is a blessing of immeasurable value. Importantly, we worked with the same technicians and nurses every time we visited the office. Eliza, our nurse, is an angel: on our bad days, her confidence in us and our future truly saved us.
To make a long story short, we are fortunate and blessed to report that almost one year to the day that we first met Dr. Stein, we had a healthy baby boy. Literally, none of it would be possible without Dr. Stein and his team at RMA.

Dr. Darren R. Lebl,Punctuality,0.6,0.919069352,"Almost two years ago, I had been suffering from chronic sciatic pain in my left leg due to a herniated lumbar disc at L4/L5. In highschool I did a lot of extreme sports, and I finally realized a long-term effect. It began to adversely affect my life, and I was no longer myself. I had visited many spine specialists and heard varying opinions, but finally decided I should go to NYC for HSS as my condition was not getting any better. I had done a lot of research on HSS spine surgeons and decided that I wanted to see Dr. Lebl based on his background and success stories. I could not be happier that I did and couldn't have predicted that he would basically save me from paralysis. After getting an MRI, he reviewed my condition and noted that my disk at L4/L5 had a significant herniation and that i would be a candidate for surgery. I decided that I wanted to avoid it for a long as possible and would try a steroid injection. About 2.5 weeks after the injection, I bent over to tie my shoe, stood up, and immediately collapsed in the worst pain of my life. It felt like someone put my entire left leg in a furnace. My leg was 90% paralyzed almost immediately, and I went to the ER within a few hours. After admission, I got an urgent MRI and discovered that my disc had ruptured and began collapsing my spinal cord, diagnosed as what is considered early cauda equina syndrome. Dr. Lebl was right, and I should have had the surgery. Amazingly, he had heard I was in the ER through his PA I was in touch with, and he sent someone to see me and get me transferred to HSS. The next morning I was at HSS, and he gracefully found a way to get me on the surgical schedule as an emergency add-on procedure. He had me out of the OR by the evening. I was then out of the hospital in about two days, and after almost a year I've seen a full recovery. If it weren't for Dr. Lebl, and if I didn't have a skilled surgeon familiar with my condition willing to operate on me in less than 24 hours, I probably wouldn't be walking normally today and my life would never be the same. Dr. Lebl is a life saver, and he is an amazing spine surgeon... One of the best in NYC. If you have a back issue, he is worth the wait to see.

Shortly after my initial breast augmentation I developed capsular contracture of the left breast which left me not only in pain, but also deformed. As a woman in her younger 20's, one can only imagine the mental and emotional strain I experienced due to this 'situation'. I was embarrassed to see and to be seen. It took me almost 10 years to find another surgeon I was able to trust. From my initial meeting with Dr. Hidalgo, it was easy to see why so many before me had entrusted their care with him. He is kind, compassionate, and reassuring. He was able to answer all questions I had whilst providing a realistic expectation. Christopher, Diane, and Ashley made scheduling appointments easy to say the least. They also offered reassurance and queried the doctor as well as the nurses whenever they were unable to offer answers or advice. Nurses MJ and Abi made me feel comfortable from the start, as well as recovery room nurse Amber and CST Ashley at the end. Dr. Marn, the anesthesiologist, was informative as well as compassionate. I went home from surgery without any post op nausea (which I have had issues with in the past). There was little pain experienced post operatively. The paperwork, website, and preoperative conversations had helped to put everything I experienced into prospective. There were no surprises along the way, which I can especially appreciate as a health care professional myself. Thank you for my newfound confidence.

Finding a doctor that is on the mark and observant and rated well by other doctors can be so hard to find when you go through insurance. But when I found him I understood why such a good doctor takes all sorts of insurance instead of just catering toward the wealthy.
It's because he cares.
But he also takes the wealthy and makes them an equal priority. I can say this after having waited like everyone else in his waiting room.
What first turned me onto the doctor is that I found out that Dr. Pineles is the doctors doctor. Apparently according to my friend who does a lot of medical billing for many doctors in New York, Dr. Pineles is one of the go to doctors when doctors need their own check ups.
You can see from my long letter that I am very thankful to Dr. Pineles.
And I am happy to say that he caught some of our issues that we were not aware of.
Like apparently the men in my family had Tinea Versicolor which is a fungus. The doctor prescribed a Selenium Sulfide shampoo and a Ketoconozole cream and monitored or blood. Now we are happily free of the fungus that we didn't even know about. See the fungus was not crusty or itchy, it just made our upper body sort of red and white splotchy. I am happy it is gone because the thought of this fungus living off my skin like a buffet,is just gross.
I thought it was just some sort of some uneven tan. Now doctor Pineles does not advertise himself as a skin doctor exactly but he helped us out with that even though I came to him for a much more sensitive issue.
He also helped me and my family (yes we used to be overweight) escape from a fate of diabetes as well.
He sent in a sample of the fungus to confirm his suspicions, and when he found out he was right, all of us were smelling like sulfer for the next two weeks lol.",Internist / Geriatrician,4,3.987980769

Meanwhile, my actual dr. Roshan and his staff were monitoring my baby for IUGR because he was so small. In fact I am being induced at 37 weeks because of IUGR. I do not trust Dr. Jaffe's medical assessments at all, and beyond that he makes me uncomfortable. He also told me he could ""Fix"" my back pain, brought me into another room and did ""Energy work"" on my back (which did nothing) and told me that I wasn't allowed to take his hand home with me.

Sorry you were actually asked to do work. He also doesn't tell you until after delivery that he doesn't perform circumcisions, then claims there's a sign in his office. So instead of communicating directly, since he doesn't actually spend real time with you during your appt, we're supposed to spend the hour long wait scrutinizing his office. At least six other patients have said he claimed the same and nurses at the hospital say they hear about this alleged poster all the time. Moritz is a joke.

I scheduled an appt which was over a month out, but well worth the wait. From the time he walked into the exam room I was at ease and laughing. He asked why I came to see him and listened as I gave my drawn out story. From there he gave me my options and told me to weigh each one and then let him know when I was ready.
It took me 9 months to get up my nerve, but when I called he was right there and ready to pick up where I had left off.
This was my first surgery and no research can prepare you for that ""day"". Once again he put me at ease and made me laugh away my fears. I could not have asked for a better surgeon or surgery.

Dr. Jeffrey A. Goldstein,Punctuality,0.677966102,0.972136677,"What can I say about Dr. Goldstein.
He is a superhero, a rockstar, the doctor that saved my life.
I would like to preface this by saying that I am terrified of doctors, and needles make me cry like a baby (a big, pathetic 32-year old baby). And while I have the utmost respect for those in the medical profession, I am an extreme avoider and probably the biggest chicken you will meet.
So this is my story.
On 2/21/11 I woke up to the most excruciating pain I've ever experienced. I lay in bed next to my husband crying silently, wishing that it would stop - but it didn't. The pain in my left arm was indescribable, but my newfound inability to lift my arm was terrifying.
My husband took me to his doctor that morning, where the anesthesiologist swiftly administered an epidural and sent me home with some heavy duty painkillers, and a prescription for an MRI.
My MRI confirmed that the disc between levels C4 and C5 was severely herniated,and that surgery was necessary. I met with 3 different doctors, praying that one of them would tell me that everything would be ok, and that I could get through this without having the surgery. Each of them said the same thing ""If you were my wife, sister or mother, I would tell you to do this tomorrow"". I pleaded with my husband to give me 2 weeks - maybe the disc would miraculously go back in on its own. He reluctantly agreed.
The pain in my arm didn't let up and it remained useless from the forearm up. I couldn't lift it or move it, it was literally dead weight. Each day was worse than the next - all I could do was lie in bed, stare at the ceiling and cry. The painkillers offered fragments of relief, but the pain was still unbearable.
After about 1 week, I agreed to meet with Dr. Goldstein. We had met with another highly esteemed NYC surgeon the week before, and I was completely disgusted by the lack of compassion and consideration that this allegedly brilliant man had given me. With some of the best surgeons in the world at my disposal, I knew that there must be a better, more suitable option. Sitting in the examination room, tears streaming down my face in anticipation, fear and pain, Dr. Goldstein walked in. He looked at me, handed me a tissue and said ""please don't cry, you'll make me cry too"". I glanced at my husband and we both knew that this was the doctor for me. At the end of my appointment, my surgery was scheduled.
The day of my discectomy I was an absolute mess. I remember sitting in the prep room with my husband, in a complete daze. Doctors and nurses filing in and out - handing me paperwork, bombarding me with information, asking me questions and asking if I had any of my own. It was completely overwhelming and terrifying, this surgery was really going to happen - and I wanted to bolt. Then Dr. Goldstein came in and reaffirmed why he is the best.
Not only are his credentials impeccable (Director of Spine Services at NYU's Hospital for Joint Diseases!), but his bedside manner is incomparable. I wanted the best surgeon, but I also wanted someone with a heart, and Dr. Goldstein is that person.
It took me a while to actually sit down and write this, but a year and a half post-op, I am doing wonderfully. I am pain-free and I have my arm back. Thank you, Dr. Goldstein for giving me my life back. You are, and will always be, my hero.",Orthopedic Surgeon,126,4.362831858

Dr. Jeffrey A. Mazlin,Punctuality,0.666666667,0.848918362,"This practice should be shut down. While it seems like I am being harsh unfortunately I am being truthful. I came to them in my 8th week of pregnancy highly recommended by a friend. Never in the entire time of treatment could they get my name right. I gained an enormous amount of weight- sometimes 10 lbs. in a day and would tell them my concern, they simply shrugged it off. In the end- i delivered my son at almost 11 lbs. naturally. They guestimated he was 8-9lbs. I was not given a sonogram since my 2nd trimester even with the excessive gain.

She has always been great about recommending me to a specialist when needed. She takes the time to explain what's going on. Which, for me, is absolutely key. I am the kind of person that will spend hours reading medical journals to understand a diagnosis and ask better questions. She never dismisses my concerns, but rather puts them in the larger context of medicine so that I understand exactly what's going on. (Side note: part of great medical care means being a good patient. I'd highly recommend becoming educated on any diagnosis you receive from any doctor. It enables you to ask good questions and know when to get a 2nd opinion. Not all doctors are as great as Dr. Meller.)
She trusts what I have to say when I tell her what is going on with me. It's been a great experience. I'm a 30 year old young professional. But when I dress down, I look very young and have visible, off-putting tattoos. I often have issues with medical professionals immediately making judgments about me and compromising my healthcare as a result. From day one, she's taken me seriously and provided nothing but top notch care.
She's also flexible. I once forgot about an appointment and ended up showing up 40 minutes late. She was still able to fit me in and did not make the appointment feel rushed despite me being so late.

Dr. John G. Stanescu,Punctuality,0.5,0.030203953,"my terrible experience with dr. Stanescu in Aug in his office in Merrick. Dr. Stanescu was supposed to do an implant crown for me, and after reading such reviews below me, I decided to give him a go since I too live in merrick Dr. Stanescu told me at my initial consult that he was going to need to adjust the crown next to my implant and the implant crown he was going to do to make a slight space for the implant crown. He then clarified to me that he's just going to shave a tiny bit of the crown and I wouldn't even notice to make room for him to make the crown and place it. After going over my insurance with him and telling him I was going to need a few other things done given that I was happy with his work, I asked if he could work with me ($) as his prices are like NYC $. He agreed to accepting $750 cash for this crown that was done in 18 minutes in his office. He didn't numb me or anything. I didn't expect him to as crowns generally don't hurt when placing them on. Suddenly he began drilling and I was in agony. Turns out he ended up doing a gingicectomy + removed tissue &aggravated my nerve between the tooth and the adjacent tooth next to it that he claimed he was only going to shave slightly. Never did he say he needed to remove gum tissue bc there was overgrowth or anything. I've had extensive oral surgery before and never felt pain like this in my life. I kept trying to tell him that I was in pain. He said let's numb not fully but around your gum. There was hardly any numbing there. He never told me he was going near my gums. Never billed out to my insurance company of such a proc The treatment plan did not indicate both a crown and a gingivectomy either. I called him as the pain worsened &I had to go in for a ""varnish"" I cried like a 5 year old in his chair. I am not such a patient to even get like this as all of my doctors and dentists have told me I am one of their best patients when it comes to compliance and pain tolerance. I literally saw stars. He refused to call in pain medicine for me. Told me to take Motrin 800 which is 4 motrins every 6-8 hours. It came to a pt where I almost had to go to the hospital after days in pain. I called him up in hysterics again as the pain just worsened and was extremely sensitive to hot/cold, and pressure. He put me on antibiotics, and said to call an endodontist. He has a thing for trying to push his endodontist and oral surgeons on you and says that they will do a cash deal just like him etc. it's almost like he gets some sort of commission off of referrals. I had my own, thank gd! I had his cell number as my friend used to go to him and he also gave it to me, but I didn't want to bother him either since he was in fact nice enough to give me his cell number. I finally texted him telling him I couldn't take the pain any longer and that I wanted him to speak to my endodontist when I got there to explain what exactly he did to me that I'm in such pain. He agreed. He spoke to my doctor on speaker and essentially said that he could have affected the nerve, as doing a gingivectomy has the chances of doing that, but that I should give it more time bc I have a 50|50 chance of either being in pain and needing the root canal in the end or not. Mind you this is over 2 weeks that I was in pain and that I waited. Initially Dr. stanescu said that the pain should dissipate after a max. Of 2 weeks. His story then changed and said up to a month. My endodontist (since knowing him for about 8 years now) advised me to do the root canal after doing a cold test and seeing that I was immed. responsive to the test indicating that the nerve was being exposed and he didn't want me in pain for work. I agreed that I didn't want to be in pain and we hung up the phone without a definite decision whether I'd end up having the procedure or not. Dr. Stanescu was fully aware that I was going to the endo. Spoke to my endo. Knew the pain I was enduring and had my cell number. He never once picked up the phone to 1. See if I ended up going through with it or 2. To see how I was feeling....it gets worse. I ended having my father contact him asking for a refund as I was recovering from the root canal procedure and was in too much pain to write up an email to him. Also, out of pure concern my father wanted to speak to him. I guess I only wrote my mothers name on the HIPPA form so he responded saying he couldn't discuss. I then emailed him for a HIPPA release form and for a refund. After several emails back and forth Dr. stanescu has never once called me. Emailed me back giving me my $750 back after having to spend not only that on my tooth but money for a root canal and more. I have yet to receive my own personal documents pertaining to my dental health and proceduralNotes from him as requested for over a month and a half and will be taking this further. He clearly needs my $750 really badly....that's the least of it. Just a warning before making a decision...be careful with this dentist. ",Dentist,14,4.059210526

Dr Keil, as the other reviewers wrote, is attentive, kind and thorough and without being overly chatty or ever seeming to waste time, she communicates caring in a professional way that makes me feel not only comfortable but truly grateful. I, too, appreciate that she travels and is involved with medicine outside the world of NYC. She is a kind, professional, wonderful doctor. As for the staff, my experiences with other offices have been so bad- I find that her staff answers the phone promptly, gets messages to her and I always get a call returned the same day and if she can see me, her very nice partner does.",Internist / Geriatrician,13,4.022123894

Dr. Keith B. Raskin,Punctuality,0.973684211,0.971775948,"Dr. Raskin is hands down, the best surgeon a patient can ever ask for. He saved my hand!
Earlier this year I suffered a laceration across 3 digits on my hand while cleaning my shed in Colorado. No big deal, right? I figured I will just go to the ER and get it stitched up and go about my day. I could not be more wrong!!! I get to the ER and they do a quick x-ray and determine that I tore a tendon. Just one. They suggested a I stitch it up and get physical therapy. After being discharged I realized that something was terribly wrong, I could not move any of my fingers. I was referred to Dr. Raskin and was squeezed in for an appointment right away. I flew out the next morning and met with Dr. Raskin who was able to determine within minutes that my injury was more severe than what I was told. I had a severe hand injury involving my flexor tendons and nerves. What did this mean? It meant that if I listened to my first diagnosis, I would not have full function of my dominant hand. I would not be able to make a fist, grab a cup of coffee, walk my dog or do any of the recreational sports that I love. I wouldn’t be able to do simple things I took for granted on a daily basis. I was devastated. On top of my injury I had no insurance and feared he wouldn’t be able to help me but the office manager Yazmin worked out a deal and payment plan with me. Dr. Raskin performed a flexor tendon and nerve repair with the assistance of his marvelous PA Ashley. Within weeks of my surgery I was able to use my hand and within two months of my surgery I was able to make a fist and ride my dirt bike! He is a true miracle worker. Dr. Raskin is an extremely skilled surgeon, who not only creates miracles but has a truly caring personality. He has excellent bed side manners and takes time with his patients. On top of being a Rockstar Surgeon he also has an outstanding team. From his front desk, to his manager Yazmin, his PA Ashley, his xray techs and state of the art surgical facility. I can not thank them enough for all of their help and kindness. Take it from a guy who flew across the country for his surgery with a life altering injury and no insurance, you will not have better results or care from anyone other than Dr. Raskin and his staff.

They are available to answer any questions you may have and are very quick to respond to an e-mail or phone message. I have Dupuytrens Contracture and had not had the full use of my hand for 5 years. It was pretty gnarled up and not attractive. He gave me my hand back and I could not be happier with the result. My hand is flat and smooth and I almost can't believe it to this day. I am still so thrilled with the outcome. I felt in such good hands and I can say that I have never felt that complete trust going into a surgery ever before.

Dr. Raskin was recommended by health care professionals that I knew, and he did not disappoint. I talked to others who were fascinated by the prospect of working on my hand - but I had no interest in satisfying someone's curiosity. My surgery was fairly complicated, yet he and Gabrielle Lanzetta were patient and explained not only the surgery, but also the recovery process. The goal was a process to return my hand to complete functionality, not only a clean surgery. Also a note, there are other surgeons who have experience, but their offices seemed more like a factory.

I was phobic. It had been 7 years and I was beside myself with fear of going. But I finally went because a tooth had broken and I didn’t want to wait until it became infected and I was in crisis. It was very important that I have a consultation before the doctor looked at my mouth and that’s what happened. We spoke for a long time. Dr. Siegelman is very laid back, gentle, caring and has a good sense of humor. The time of terror in the chair was actually bearable. He was so gentle and calming.
I needed a lot of work and the major stuff was all done under anesthesia. But even that is done with the smallest attention to detail: you arrive and get a paper cup with a paper umbrella of meds to relax you. When you are relaxed, you go into a darkened room and lie down on a very comfortable chair. A blanket is wrapped around you. Soft music is playing. And then you are awake and it’s over! Both times I was under I had a ton of work done and virtually no pain afterwards.
I have had other work done without anesthesia from both Dr. Seigelman and Dr. Currier and both are gentle and kind and do a great job.
No matter how phobic you are, the staff are trained to deal with it. Many patients hadn’t been to the dentist for 20 or more years.
Highest recommendation!

Dr. Mehran Morovati,Punctuality,0,0.218251564,"
This guy is a money grubbing quack with ZERO professionalism nor bedside manners.
I was assigned to this office and came in for a checkup/cleaning. They performed the routine x-ray and stated I needed 12 fillings. I've had a check up last year and everything was fine but now he's stating they would need to remove old silver fillings and it would take 3 sessions.
After completing the session, he abruptly leaves without informing me that it was done or what the follow-up procedures were (ie don't eat for 3 hours etc.). It turns out that he ran off to start figuring out the self-pay liability with his biller. After standing around for 20 minutes, he informs me that I owe ~$150 in copays (no one from his office mentioned prior to this procedure) and I need to pay for this now. I asked for an itemized bill and receipt, he said he doesn't have it and just shows me a copy of my xray/chart with numbers scribbled next to it.
This quack is supposed to be a medical professional, but instead he rushes off after a procedure to figure out what the patient owed? If he knew what was needed from the consultation, shouldn't he have calculated this prior to the procedures and inform the patient? He then screamed- ""NO, IT'S YOUR JOB TO KNOW HOW MUCH YOU OWE. IT'S NOT MY JOB NOR MY BILLER'S JOB TO KNOW YOUR OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES"".
He then informed me that it will no longer be 2 follow-up sessions, but 4 because he will be paid MORE for each visit by the insurance. This guy is quack and is defrauding the healthcare system. He was also very upset at the fact that him getting paid $500 an hour is not enough.
At this point, I was calmly explaining to him that I felt uncomfortable paying unless I receive an itemized bill and receipt. He vehemently stated NO and threatened to send my claim to collections if I didn't pay at once. I left the office and told him to send me the bill and contact my insurance company. All this trouble because I asked for a receipt and detailed bill so I can see what I'm paying for?

I had my surgery June 25, 2005, following the surgery the rehabilitation process was extensive let alone painful. I couldn’t wait for my post-op appointment to see how well my spine was corrected, but that day would never come. My parents received a phone call from Dr. O’Leary himself telling us to come into the office on Labor Day weekend. After welcoming us, he had us sit down in his Madison Avenue office while he showed us the x-rays from my surgery. As I was comparing the pre and post-operational x-rays, I couldn’t tell the difference between them. The first words out of his mouth were “ There happens to have been a misjudgment, we fused the rod on the wrong part of your spine”. That simple word “misjudgment” would forever haunt my life. Now 26 years old with a “hump back” limited to what I can do, feeling the pain radiating up and down my spine everyday is NO way to live.

Dr. Ron Noy,Punctuality,1,0.283954013,"My experience from start to finish with Dr. Ron Noy has been excellent. The staff was extremely helpful with absolutely everything. My initial appointment was scheduled soon after I called the office. Dr. Noy was extremely thorough with his examination of my fully torn ACL and partially torn meniscus. He looked over my MRI and explained to me exactly what had happened with the ligaments in my knee. He answered all the questions that I had concerning my injury and the surgery that was necessary to fix my injury. He explained to me how the surgery would be performed, the exact medications that I would need, the exact dosages and times in which I should take the medicines, and the machines necessary for a quick and proper recovery. A motion machine was dropped off to my home 2 days before the surgery along with a cold therapy unit which helps ice the knee and reduce swelling much better than an ice pack or a bag of peas could. I must add that I saw two other orthopedic surgeons for opinions and a diagnosis before I visited Dr. Noy’s office. I should have saved myself the time and went to him first. One of the previous surgeons that I had visited for an opinion was not able to detect that I had damage to my patellar tendon and that using a section of that ligament to reconstruct my ACL would be damaging to my patellar tendon (basically fix one thing and have an issue with another). Dr. Noy on the other hand, was able to notice that from the MRI and used a cadaver tendon to construct the ACL. The cadaver tendon he used is one of the strongest tendons in the body compared to a hamstring tendon or patellar tendon. I only have 4 tiny incisions on my knee rather than a huge scar that is six inches down my knee. I DID NOT take any narcotics during my entire recovery, just Tylenol and Aleve. His technique allows for minimal pain and quicker recovery. I was up and walking within a week and able to flex my leg 125 degrees within 2.5 weeks. I recommend Dr. Noy to everyone. You can tell that he enjoys what he does and has a passion for his work. I have never come across a more hands on doctor.",Orthopedic Surgeon,8,4.074074074

My appointment was for 2:00 and I arrived 10 minutes earlier and was immediately told that he had to go to Mount Sinai for an emergency but is on his way back to the office. By the time I finished completing the questionnaire he entered so I really didn't have to wait. What amazed me the most about Dr. Palmon was that he listened. He was unbelievably focused on trying to understand what is my situation. He then did some tests and asked me to come again in 2 weeks. I did and after a very short wait entered his room and was told that ""we have a plan"" he said that a combination of drugs and change of diet will help me. It is now 2 months later and I am thrilled, pain free and feeling fantastic. Thank you Dr. Palmon",Internist / Geriatrician,5,4.047619048

Dr Stromer is charming and knowledgable- someone I was very excited to deliver my first child. I am now 38.5 weeks pregnant, and found out there is an issue with a lapse in my insurance coverage. The doctors office told me not to worry about, as they will bill me and everything will be fine. When Dr Stromer heard about this I suppose he felt it was a great opportunity to make some cash. He called me and told me that he is unable to deliver my baby without pre-payment and will give me a 'great deal' if I pay cash and do it for $2k. He also explained that it was too late in my pregnancy to see another dr and if we didnt settle this 'he would hate to see me with a resident'. On top of the $2k he said he'd only charge me $100 for the circumcision. Why is this man trying to bargain with a pregnant woman who is 1 week away from delivery. I am very confidant a dr like this who so openly wants to discuss money wouldnt hesitate to administer medicine that isnt needed, perform c sections for a higher compensation, etc. He is clearly a con artist.
I am very grateful that my insurance lapsed and I was able to see his true colors and cares. If you have a great medical coverage I'm sure you will only see his charming side- but believe me... He is doing things in the background to bill your insurance the most possible compensation.
On top of all of the above mentioned-- I went in for my routine visit and to express my concern for delivery however when I arrived at the office I was told he had to cancel for an emergency delivery, which I found out was not true . I complained to the office about how far I travelled, and how I was planning on making a complaint about this and magically he called the office and said he can hold off on the delivery and come see me...

I asked for a cost plan and he said it was 100% covered by my insurance and that his assistant had already called and confirmed this. Now he is trying to charge me over $1550 for this appliance!! His assistant is extremely rude and frankly, this mouth splint looks exactly like what you can buy at the drugstore for $25. DO NOT TAKE THEIR WORD when they tell you what a procedure will cost. I don't know how I'm going to pay for this and I surely wouldn't have agreed to such a ridiculously overpriced mouth guard.

From my first consultation, he explained what the treatment options were and revealed his suspicion that I would need surgery in the end. He first tried a splint (bite plate) and then Botox injections, neither of which helped in my case. I ended up having to have surgery on both sides. I was completely confident having Dr. Black do the surgery. He is the type of doctor who was born to do what he does.

My friends recommend me to Dr. Stavros Lazarou and I will be forever grateful to them. The moment he introduced himself to me and my husband, I just felt that he would be the doctor I would stick with. I was 8 weeks pregnant with my 1st baby, he guided me throughout my pregnancy. He is a very professional doctor, he attended to all my concerns and he always took his time to explain thoroughly each step we were taking. I have never felt rushed at my appointments. He was always on call for any questions or concerns I had, always took the time to listen.
He delivered my baby boy 2 months ago (at Winthrop) via c-section under general anesthesia and i think if it was any other doctor I would have been scared to death. It was my first surgery and I was very anxious and nervous about everything yet he kept reassuring me before the surgery began that everything was going to be great and I had nothing to worry about.
My son was born after midnight and Dr. Lazarou stayed at the hospital until I woke up from the anesthesia to make sure I was okay. ( Even though he wasn't on call!!)
He kepted in contact with me the entire stay at the hospital and kepted checking up on me in person as well before we left to go home.
Since then my incision has healed wonderfully as well.
I could go on and on about how wonderful Dr. Lazarou is at his job. Such a profectionist. I am not planning on changing doctors anytime soon and if you are reading this wondering if you should make an appointment, stop hesitating. You will not be in better hands than his.

When I called to make an appointment to start at the practice I was given Dr. Roberts. I saw him throughout my pregnancy. At the end of my pregnancy someone in the waiting room told me make sure you get to see Dr. Lazarou before you deliver. I asked why? She said because during her whole pregnancy she saw Dr. Roberts and when it came time for delivery her daughter was delivered by Dr. Lazarou. I thought maybe Dr. Lazarou was on call and that patient didn't realize that. I did see Dr. Lazarou twice before my delivery day and really liked him. Thinking it was a coincidence that he delivered my baby and the other lady's daughter I Later learned from staff in the hospital that Dr. Roberts does not do deliveries. I feel I was definitely mislead throughout my visits with Dr. Roberts and was not told that. When I have another child I will make sure To see Dr. Lazarou the whole time. Dr. Lazarou is a true professional. An OB who truly loves his job and treats you as if you are family, he is very patient, attentive and will take the time to answer questions you have. Need an OB?

This is my first pregnancy, and being intimidated by my own doctor of my own labor is something I have never expected of medical professionals at Cornell. To the question 'will I be able to move during labor' his response was ""yes"", even though he perfectly well knows that at Cornell they hook you up to IV when they accept you, and then attach the stationary monitor (in 2015!!!!!!!! GE released wireless monitors in 2011, Cornell uses stationary monitors!!!!) right away, which will virtually abolish your ability to move around. When I emailed the doctor to ask him to clarify these issues for me, I have received no response, even though the nurses always responded within 2-3 hours before. I am a Weill Cornell alum, and I am ashamed that this doctor is part of the practice. To my question 'I have a low blood pressure that drops during the day"", his response was ""there are all these young healthy women with generally low blood pressure running around, and when they get pregnant their blood pressure drops more' - what a delightful bout of mysogeny - I am an executive director at the largest swiss bank, YOUNG WOMEN RUNNING AROUND????

Dr. Tara Shirazian,Konwledge,1,0.971288199,"I came to see Dr.Shirazian after having a few years of fibroid issues which my original doctor was not taking care of properly. Dr Shirazian was booked for months but when I told her staff that I was in need of her for a second opinion they took me in right away. Dr. S was ready to remove the last fibroid without hesitation. I struggled for years with fibroids that caused me trips to the ER due to excessive hemorrhaging during my periods. I was scared and felt alone but as soon as I met with the Dr. I knew I had come to the right place. She got me in for surgery right away (even on a day she doesn't typically operate) and even though we knew the recovery was harder, we decided on an abdominal myomectomy. She ensured this was the only way to guarantee a successful removal. She held my hand and played music before the surgery and made me feel very comforted. She answered any questions my mom and I both had, and we had A LOT! I couldn't thank her enough for being such an amazing doctor and human! So many doctors lack empathy today and she definitely makes up for them! If you have fibroid problems, go see Dr. Shirazian.

She never considered endometriosis, of which I showed all symptoms. After asking repeatedly how best I should try to conceive, her advise was to have intercourse every other day from days 11-19, but she incorrectly diagnosed my cycles to begin with. She told me not to bother with charting cervical mucous or basal body temp. No once did she try to find our if and when I was ovulating, or if my hormone levels were normal. At the 5th month I urged her to start fertility testing. She said to wait 1 month. Shortly after I had spotting, more irregular than before, so then called her to discuss what to do.

They were a good tag team and made sure someone was always going to follow up with you. Also, Dr. Cheon has a ~90% patient delivery rate. Many other doctors rotate their ""on call"" times at hospitals so you might see one doctor most of your pregnancy only to have her/his colleague deliver your baby!

Dr. William P. Boxer,Punctuality,0.571428571,0.665057601,"Dr. Boxer is a superb physician, very compassionate and very intelligent. Most importantly, he listens most of the time and speaks only after he has a clear idea of how my problem developed. He has excellent bedside manner, and explained his impressions in words I could understand. The staff in his office are kind and considerate, both on the phone and in person. I observed them with other patients, and despite being pressured and sometimes being spoken to rudely, they responded gently to calm the situation...and were effective. His diagnosis was correct, and the medication he prescribed for me worked immediately. My only criticism is that he was twenty minutes late. However, it was clear from the other patients in the waiting room, that several who preceded me were quiet ill, and that the waiting time that I experienced was because he was attending to them. He is one of the most knowledgable doctors I have ever seen and I would recommend him highly to others.",Internist / Geriatrician,14,4.006578947

Dr. William Schell,Punctuality,1,0.120350454,"He has been great to me so far. I am in between insurance coverage right now, and with my chronic pain issues, I am a continual patient of his. He has given me tons of free samples, free cortisone injections, and even reduced cost visits. He got me what should have been a $1200 MRI for only $200. As a matter of fact, I just saw the man yesterday and he charged me absolutely nothing! I have RSD in my foot which he dx'd when most other orthos either don't know of it or don't believe in it. I would recommend him to anyone!",Orthopedic Surgeon,6,4.051886792

Dr. Yiling Shiao,Punctuality,1,0.165951926,"My wife and I traveled to NYC this long weekend to celebrate our anniversary. As we are enjoying a wonderful afternoon walk in the city, toothache started to bother me. On the same night, the toothache started to be so unbearable that I couldn't even sleep. Out of desperation, I did a search for dental practice close to our hotel. And that is when I found Dr. Shiao's practice which is right around the corner from Grand Central. When I arrived, I was very impressed by how clean and beautiful the practice. Dr. Shiao was very professional and treat me with utmost care. She did some temporary measure to ease my pain and wrote down a note so I can bring back to my own dentist in Toronto. Although knowing that I won't be returning, she instructed the assistant to X-ray me and explain to me my problem. What a professional!! I wish my own dentist has 1/2 the heart Dr. Shiao has. Thank you Dr. Shiao, you are a true professional.",Dentist,4,4.036057692
Dr. Yiling Shiao,Staff,1,0.308461273,"I felt very much at ease under the care of Dr. Yi-Ling Shiao. She as well as her dental assistants and office assistants were very professional and personable. I feel like I've known them for years although I've only been a patient for only three months. Wait time for my visits were minimal. I was there for oral examination, deep cleaning, and dental surgery. The 45-minute surgery, which included sutures afterward to control the bleeding, was a success as I experienced no pain and only minor bleeding following the dental procedure. Also, I am no longer experiencing the problems that I had prior to surgery. A follow-up visit yesterday confirmed that all is well. The facility is pretty spacious and very modern. A plasma TV is in front of each dental chair, which also functions as a massage chair. I didn't expect to feel so much at home at a dentist office. I highly recommend Dr. Shiao as I feel that she takes good care of her patients and the cost is very reasonable.",Dentist,4,4.036057692
Dr. Zachary Bregman,Punctuality,0.782608696,0.976549442,"Now I've had plenty of doctors in the past but I can honestly say Dr.Bregman is the most helpful, down to earth, no B.S. Gonna find the soltuion to your health issues Doctor out there. I 1st came into his office for a routine physical and what I got was a doctor that told me something I will never forget ""Darryl, I'm going to change your life"" and I believe him. These days it seems like a visit to the doctor involves little contact with an actual doctor. Instead, most of the time is spent explaining problems to assistants and having blood drawn by nurses. Many doctors have been beefing up their support staff physician assistants and nurse practitioners to help them squeeze in more patients. However this isnt the case with Dr.Bregman. He is the real deal. Thumbs Up All the way",Internist / Geriatrician,25,4.13
Dr. Zachary Bregman,Staff,1,0.224042106,"I have been a patient of Dr Bregman for over a decade now and in that time I have always found him to be professional, concerned for my well being and never failing to educate me on my health problems besides treating me. He is an individual of great integrity, knowledge, and intelligence. He is always patient and will take as much time as necessary to discuss one's health issues. I recommend him highly. -Prakash Aswani",Internist / Geriatrician,25,4.13

He tries very hard to make his patients happy. However, I can't say that much for some of the staff in his office. In particular, one of the front desk staff, a young blond woman, was extremely rude and unpleasant. She doesn't know how to behave with patients at all. I have not seen her around the office lately, and I have felt much more at ease.",Internist / Geriatrician,5,3.969047619
